# Close Pushups

## Performance

- Begin this technique in the same top position as full pushups (Step 5), but with the hands touching. You don't need to overlap the hands or form a "diamond" between the thumbs and index fingers; it is sufficient for the tips of the index fingers to touch.
- From the straight arm start position, lower yourself until your chest gently touches the backs of your hands.
- Pause briefly before pressing back to the start position.
