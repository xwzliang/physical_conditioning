# Diagonal Clutch

## Performance

- Approach your vertical base, and get into the basic clutch hold. From here, get into a diagonal tuck clutch (step 3).
- Once you are in position, keep your trunk diagonal and extend both legs outwards until they are perfectly straight. At this point, your trunk and straight legs should form a diagonal line.
- Hold the position, breathing normally.
