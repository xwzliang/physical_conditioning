## Warming Up

- Warming up is important
- Too much is not necessary
- Two to four easier rep sets (maybe a 20 rep set and a 15 rep set, which you could do 40 and 30 reps respectively if pushed)

## Starting Slow

- Patience is important
- Start from step 1
- At least four weeks before moving to next step
- Put strength in the bank, training super-hard has its drawback
- But do train hard once your joints and musles are ready for it
- Give muscles and soft tissues the precious time they need to develop, this is important

## Making Progress

- Start by meeting the beginner standard, aim to add 1 rep every week or two
- If you don't meet the beginner standard, go back to the former step and keep working on it
- When you are able to do ten reps, begin adding another work set 
- Always use perfect form
- Don't use momentum, control the negative portion of the movement as much as the positive, pause one second at the bottom

## Consolidation Training

- Instead of working the new exercise once or twice a week, try working it every day, maybe twice or three times a day
- Instead of doing as many reps as possible, only do one-two at the very most
- Use it when it is tough to move from one step to the next, you are having a problem getting a handful of reps on the new exercise

## Work Sets and Rest

- Volume is for stamina and intensity is for strength
- A couple of work sets is enough for strength, but pour your effort into the most difficult exercises you can do
- Between work sets, rest as briefly as possible for stamina, as long as you like for strength
- Be aware rest for more than five minutes the body will start to cool down, so do pace the room or stretch out the muscles you will use

## Record Your Training

- Memory can be unreliable
- Help to analyze and set new goal (self-coaching)
- Quick and efficient (date, list of exercises, sets and reps)
