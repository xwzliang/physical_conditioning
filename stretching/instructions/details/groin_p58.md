- Put the soles of your feet together and hold onto your toes. Gently pull yourself forward, bending from the hips until you feel a good stretch in your groin. You may also feel a stretch in the back. Hold for 20 seconds. Do not make the initial movement for this stretch from your head and shoulders. Move from the hips. Try to get your elbows on the outside of your legs so you are stable and balanced. Contract your abdominal muscles mildly as you lean forward; this will increase your forward flexibility.
