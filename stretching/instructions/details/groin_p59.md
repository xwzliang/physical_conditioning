- PNF Technique: Comract-Relax-Stretch. With your hands supplying slight resistance on the insides of opposite thighs, try to bring your knees together just enough to contract the muscles in the groin (fig. 1). Hold this stabilized tension for 4-5 seconds. then relax and stretch the groin as in the preceding stretches (fig. 2). This will help relax a tight groin area. This technique of contract-relax-stretch is valuable for athletes with groin problems.
