- Bring your knees together and rest your feet on the floor. Interlace your fingers behind your head with your arms on the floor (fig. 1). Now lift the left leg over the right leg (fig. 2). From here, use your left leg to pull your right leg toward the floor (fig. 3) until you feel a good stretch along the side of the hip or in the lower back. Relax. Keep the upper back, back of head, shoulders, and elbows flat on the floor. Hold for 10-20 seconds. The idea is not to touch the floor with your right knee, but to stretch within your limits. Repeat the stretch for the other side, crossing the right over the left leg and pulling down to the right. Exhale as you go into the stretch, then breathe rhythmically as you stretch.
