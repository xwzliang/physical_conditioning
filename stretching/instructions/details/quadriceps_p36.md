- Lie on your left side and rest the sIde of your head in the palm of your left hand. Hold the top of your right foot with your right hand between the toes and ankle joint. Gently pull the right heel toward the right buttock to stretch the ankle and quadriceps (front of thigh). Hold an easy stretch for 10 seconds.
- Now move the front of your right hip forward by contracting the right thigh (quadriceps) muscles as you push your right foot into your right hand. This should stretch the front of your thigh and relax your hamstrings. Hold an easy stretch for 10 seconds. Keep the body in a straight line. Now stretch the left leg in the same way. (You may also get a good stretch in the front of the shoulder.) At first it may be hard to hold this for very long. Just work on the proper way to stretch without worrying about flexibility or how you look. Stretching regularly will create a positive change. I like to follow this stretch with the hamstrings stretch at the top of page 58.
