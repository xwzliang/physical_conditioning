- To stretch the hamstrings, straighten the right leg with the sole of your left foot slightly touching the inside of your right thigh. You are now in the straight-leg, bent-knee position (fig. 1). Slowly bend forward from the hips toward the foot of the straight leg (fig. 2) until you create the slightest feeling of stretch tension. Hold for 10-15 Seconds. After the stretch tension has diminished, bend forward from the hips a bit more. Exhale as you hold this developmental stretch for 10 seconds, breathing rhythmically. Then switch sides and stretch the left leg in the same manner.
- During this stretch, keep the foot of the straight leg upright, with the ankle and toes relaxed. Be sure the quadriceps are soft to the touch (relaxed). Do not dip your head forward when initiating the stretch.
- I have found that it is best to stretch your quads first, then the hamstrings of the same leg. It is easier to stretch the hamstrings after the quadriceps have been stretched.
