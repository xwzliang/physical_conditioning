- To reduce tension in the neck: While still lying on the floor, you can stretch your upper spine and neck. Interlace your fingers behind your head at about ear level. Slowly pull your head forward until you feel a slight stretch in the back of the neck. Hold for 3-5 seconds, then slowly return to the original starting position. Do this 3-4 times to loosen up the upper spine and neck gradually. Keep your jaw relaxed (back teeth slightly separated) and keep breathing.
