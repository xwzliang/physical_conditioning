- Now move the front of your right hip forward by contracting the right thigh (quadriceps) muscles as you push your right foot into your right hand. This should stretch the front of your thigh and relax your hamstrings. Hold an easy stretch for 10 seconds. Keep the body in a straight line. Now stretch the left leg in the same way. (You may also get a good stretch in the front of the shoulder.) At first it may be hard to hold this for very long. Just work on the proper way to stretch without worrying about flexibility or how you look. Stretching regularly will create a positive change. I like to follow this stretch with the hamstrings stretch at the top of page 58.
