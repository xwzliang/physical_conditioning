- Lie on your back and lift your leg up toward a 90Â° angle at the thigh joint. Keep the lower back flat against the floor. Hold for 15-20 seconds. Repeat for other leg. If necessary, hold onto the back of your leg to create the stretch. Or put a towel or elastic cord around the bottom of your foot and pull gently. Only stretch as far as is comfortable. Also, you can place a pillow under your head for more comfort.
