- Start in a standing position with your feet about shoulder-width apart and pointed straight ahead. Slowly bend forward from the hips. Keep your knees slightly bent (1 inch) during the stretch so your lower back is not stressed. Let your neck and arms relax. Go to the point where you feel a slight stretch in the back of your legs. Stretch in this easy phase for 10-15 seconds, until you are relaxed. Let yourself relax physically by mentally concentrating on the area being stretched. Do not stretch with your knees locked, or bounce when you stretch. Simply hold an easy stretch.
- When you do this stretch, you will feel it mostly in your hamstrings (back of thighs) and back of the knees. Your back will also be stretched, but you will feel this stretch mostly in the back of your legs.
- Important: Whenever you bend at the waist to stretch, remember to bend your knees slightly (1 inch or so). It takes the pressure off your lower back. Use the big muscles of the upper legs to stand up, instead of the small muscles of the lower back. Never bring yourself to an upright position with knees locked.
- This principle is also important in lifting heavy objects off the ground
