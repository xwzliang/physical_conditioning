- To relieve tension in your lower back, tighten your butt (gluteus) muscles and, at the same time, tighten your abdominal muscles to flatten your lower back. Hold this tension for 5-8 seconds, then relax. Repeat 2--3 times. Concentrate on maintaining constant muscle contraction. This pelvic tilting exercise will strengthen the butt (gluteus) and abdominal muscles so that you are able to sit and stand with good posture.
- Shoulder Blade Pinch and Gluteus Tightener: Now, simultaneously do the shoulder blade pinch, flatten your lower back, and tighten your butt muscles. Hold contraction for 5 secunds, then relax and pull your head forward to stretch the back of your neck and upper back. Repeat 3-4 times. This feels great.
