- Bend your left knee at 90Â° and, with your right hand, pull that bent leg up and over your other leg as shown above. Turn your head to look toward the hand of the left arm that is straight out from the shoulder (head should be resting on floor, not held up). Now, using the right hand on your left thigh (resting just above knee) pull your bent (left) leg down toward the floor until you get a mild stretch feeling in your lower back and side of hip. Relax your feet and ankles and keep the back of your shoulders flat on the floor. Hold an easy stretch for 15-20 seconds, each side.
