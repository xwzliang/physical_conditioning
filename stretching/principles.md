# Principles

## The Right Way To Stretch

- Relax, take your time, not being a hurry 
- Breathe easily, do not hold breath. Breathe slowly, deeply, and naturally - exhale as you bend forward. Do not stretch to a point where you cannot breathe normally
- Don't stretch too far, especially in the beginning. Get a slight stretch and increase it after you feel yourself relax
- Tune into your body. Adjust each stretch to your own personal flexibility, which will vary daily. If the tension becomes greater as you stretch, you are overdoing it. Ease off into a more comfortable position
- Focus on muscles and joints being stretched. Relax while you concentrate on the area being stretched
- "Go by the Feel". Feel the stretch. Be guided by the feel of the stretch, not by how far you can stretch. Hold only stretch tensions that feel good
- If you are stretching correctly, the stretch feeling should slightly subside as you hold the stretch

## Two Phases

- The Easy Stretch. Stretch until you feel a slight mild tension and hold for 5-10 seconds. Relax. As you hold the stretch, the feeling of tension should diminish. If it doesn't, ease off slightly into a more comfortable stretch
- The Developmental Stretch. Now, move a fraction of an inch farther into the stretch until you feel mild tension again. Hold for 5 to 10 seconds. Again, the feeling should diminish or stay the same. If the tension increases or becomes painful, you are overstretching

## Keep in mind

- No bouncing! Bouncing tightens the very muscles you are trying to stretch
- No pain! Forced painful stretches do more harm than good. The"no gain without pain" theory does not apply to stretching. Stretching should not be painful
- Don't focus on flexibility. Just learn to stretch properly and flexibility will come with time
- Do not compare yourself with others. We are all different. Comparisons may lead to overstretching
- Stretching is not exercise! You are stretching, not exercising. You don't need to push it. Stretching is a mild, gentle activity
- Stretching keeps your body ready for movement
- You can control what you feel by what you do
- Stretch whenever you feel like it. It will always make you feel good
- Regularity is one of the most important factors in stretching. Stretch regularly and you will naturally want to become more active and fit
