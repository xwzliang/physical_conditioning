# Principles of ball handling and dribbling

## Triple threat position

- The first thing you should learn, you can pass, shoot, or dribble - hence the name
- Put the ball into the triple threat position once get the ball, this should be your instinct
- Grip the ball firmly near your right or left hip, eyes facing forward so you can see everything

## Tips about dribbling

- Whenever you dribble the basketball, touch the ball with your fingertips and NEVER with the palm of your hand. This gives you the best possible control of the ball.
- The correct position to dribble is knees bent and shoulder-width apart, keeping your back straight. Your head should always be up and eyes out in front, so you can see everything that is happening on the court.  NEVER stare downwards at the ball.
- Dribbling is always done both on your right side or your left but NEVER in front of you.
- You want to keep your hand on the ball as long as possible (fully extend your arm on every dribble and get your hand as low to the ground as possible). If someone tries to steal the ball from you, and your hand is on the ball, you can change the direction of the ball to avoid their hands. However, as soon as you let go of the ball, it is out of your control.
- Protect the ball with your opposite hand. If someone tries to reach in and steal the ball, you can block their hand away with your opposite hand.
- Practice with both hands! You will need to use both hands in a real basketball game, so get comfortable using both of your hands when you practice. 

## The basic three dribbles

- The control dribble. Slow and mid-speed. You must get a wider and lower base, crouching lower to the ground while dribbling the basketball lower to the ground. Use your body, legs, and opposite arm to shield the basketball and protect it from being stolen. Anytime you drive by someone or do a crossover, you should use your control dribble.
- The speed dribble. Used as you run at top speed, dribbling down the court. For this dribble, you basically throw the ball in front of you and run to catch up to it. You fully extend your arm forward and then flick your wrist down.
- The power protection dribble. used anytime someone gets extremely close to you. Turn your body sideways as you dribble and get low to the ground. This creates space between you and your opponent, so it is harder for them to steal the ball. The lower the dribble the harder it is for the defender to steal it, and it's easier for you to control it.

## Two basic ways to get around without dribbling

- The basic rip through drive. You rip the ball in front of you and off to the side a bit, as you drive by your opponent. You must make sure you rip the ball low to the ground, so it will be difficult for your defender to steal. You must drive in a straight line, as much as possible, and try to blow by your defender.
- The jab fake, rip through drive. This is the same as the rip through drive, except you fake going in one direction, then you go the other way.  The key to this is really making it look as if you are going to go in one direction, then go the other way. You can make it look as if you are going in the direction by jabbing quickly with your foot and entire body, and by faking with the ball.

## Crossovers

- A crossover is when you are dribbling the basketball in one hand and you fake like you are going to go in one direction, then you quickly switch the ball to the other hand and go in the opposite direction.
- In order to do a good crossover, you have to really sell the fake. The simplest way to do this is to practice and literally make your crossovers look identical to what you would do if you were actually going in that direction.
- Moving the ball as quickly as you can is essential to a good crossover.
- Keep your head up so you can see what is happening around you on the basketball court and use your opposite hand to protect the ball from your defender reaching in.
- Go in a straight line. The quickest way from point A to point B is in a straight line. When you try to go around your defenders, attack them at straight-on angles. Don't run in a curve and try to get around them.

## Four-and-a-half crossovers

- The basic left-to-right, or right-to-left crossover. This is simply dribbling with one hand and then switching to the other. It's simple but extremely effective. It should be used whenever you have enough space between you and your defender so that they cannot steal the ball.
- The between-the-legs crossover. This crossover should be used when you are closer to your defender, and the ball would get stolen if you were to use a regular left to right/right to left crossover.
- The behind-the-back crossover. This crossover should be used when your defender is extremely close to you. You do not have enough space to do a regular crossover or between the legs crossover.
- The spin crossover. This should be used when the defender is extremely close to you and they are already leaning a bit in one direction. Whatever way they are leaning, you simply do a spin and rotate around them in the opposite direction.
- The half crossover; the in and out. This is a good crossover to use when you want to fake using a screen and go in the opposite direction. It is also a great setup for a double crossover but can be used at any time to get around someone (if there is enough space).
- Double and triple crossovers are used if your defender cuts you off after you have done your first crossover. If this happens, you simply do another crossover (double crossover), and if you get cut off one more time, you do another crossover (triple crossover). Double and triple crossovers consist of any combinations of the four-and-a-half fundamental crossovers.
