# Principles of Shooting

## Three qualities

- Fast Release. If you can't release the ball fast enough, players will block your shot. Therefore, you need to be able to release the ball as quickly as you can to avoid players from contesting or blocking your shot.
- Accuracy. This is plain and simple. You need to be able to accurately shoot the ball and get it in.
- Consistency. You need to be able to consistently get the ball in the net. This is achieved by shooting with the same technique every time.

If your technique allows you to have these three qualities, it doesn't matter if your shot looks ugly or pretty, you will be a great shooter.

# Six steps

1. Shooting Stance

Get into your triple threat position, face your feet and body to the net, make sure your torso is completely upright (not leaning in any direction), and stare at the rim. It doesn't matter if you stare at the front, back, or entire rim. Every player is different. Choose whatever you feel comfortable doing and stick to it!

1. Holding the Ball

	- spread your fingertips so they cover a comfortable amount of the ball. REMEMBER: The ball should be on your fingertips and not touching your palm. This allows for optimum control.
	- your shooting hand is your dominant hand and should be placed in the middle of the ball, and your guide hand should be placed on the side. REMEMBER: You do not actually shoot the ball with your guide hand. It is only used to hold onto the ball and help aim or “guide” the shot.
	- your fingertips should be lined up perpendicular to the seams of the basketball. This allows the ball to get a perfect backspin upon release, which will help increase its trajectory and also increase its chances of going in if it bounces off the rim. However, don't ever line your fingers up perpendicular to the seams if it means sacrificing a fast release and puts you in jeopardy of getting blocked.

1. Two 90-Degree Hooks

This will set ypu up for a fast release
	- bend your wrist backward until it goes to roughly 90 degrees
	- bend your forearm backward, until the point where your forearm and bicep meet and create roughly a 90-degree angle.

1. Rising Up

You will now raise the ball up toward your head as you simultaneously begin to jump. Maintain the torso in its upright position. You will bring the ball up in a completely straight line from your feet all the way up to your head. Your shooting elbow should be under the ball and in alignment with your foot, knee, and hip.

You will maintain the two 90-degree hooks the entire time as you bring the ball toward your head and begin your jump. Just before your feet leave the ground and the ball is near the top of your head, you will reach your set point. This is the point that you stop at before you extend your arm and flick your wrist to shoot. You will actually stay in your set point for a fraction of a second until you reach the top of your jump and release your shot. Every player has a different set point. Someone like Kevin Garnett's set point is actually behind his head.  However, the majority of NBA players' set points are slightly above their head and in front of their face. Play around and find a comfortable set point and stick to it!

1. Leaving the Ground and Releasing the Shot

Your feet and body will now leave the ground and you will rise into the air. You keep the ball and your entire body in the exact same position that it was in before you left the ground until you are near the top of your jump. Do not lean in any direction.  

Once you are near the top of your jump, extend your arm upward into the air and flick your wrist downward as you keep your fingertips spread, and the ball leaves your hands toward the net. Your fingers should end up like a fish hook, pointing toward the ground. Time your shot so that the ball leaves your hands when you are at the top of your jump (highest point in the air).

The TV show Sports Science calculated that the optimum angle of release that your arm should be at when you shoot is 46 to 50 degrees. After the ball leaves your hands, many top coaches teach their players to hold their release. This means that you maintain the same position that you had when the ball left your hands. This allows you to get a good follow through and enables you to analyze your shot. For example, you can look at your arm/wrist/fingers and see if the angle of your arm was too high/low/far to the right/far to the left, and to see if your wrist was bent down enough and your fingers were spread out enough.

1. Analyzing the Shot

The ball has left your hands and it will have done one of two things; go in or miss. No matter what happens, every time, after you shoot, analyze what happened. Think about what you did wrong and what you did right. Learn from any mistakes you made and make the proper adjustments for the next shot you take.

TIP: Get a video camera and record yourself shooting. By doing this, you will pick up on many details that you wouldn't have noticed from shooting without a camera. Sometimes you think your body is doing one thing, but it is actually doing something completely different. A camera can save you a lot of time when learning how to shoot properly. Many top NCAA and NBA players have analyzed videos of their shots at some point or another in their careers.

## Free throw shooting

Here is what Michael Jordan says is the right way for free throw shooting:

1. Make sure you have your balance. It does not mean that both of your feet must be parallel. Some players keep their right foot or the left foot slightly ahead to maintain proper balance.

2. As you get into balance, you must clear your mind of the game and think about your practice sessions. That way, you will be relaxed and comfortable. This is very important.

3. Once you have the balance, you have three choices for focal points, i.e. your target: the rim, inside the rim or the back of the rim.  

4. When you raise your hand, the ball must be at your fingertips, while your forearm should be vertical. The ball should not be on your palms since that will lessen your control over the ball.

5. When taking the shot, try to force your first three fingers from the thumb to work more than the last two. This will create backspin and increase the possibility of the ball going in the basket if it hits the rim.

6. While shooting, the force must come from your feet, transfer through the rest of your body, and release through your fingers as you take the shot.

7. Lastly, make free shooting a ritual and only use the same set of movements every time you take a shot. For Michael Jordan, it was spinning the ball once, dribbling it three times, and spinning it again right before taking the shot.

## Long range shooting

Eyes on the Rim!  
Shouldn't the title say eye on the ball? Well, no. The aim of dribbling and ball handling exercise is to get as much eye time away from the ball as possible. You should focus on anything but the ball, and the more you practice the less frequent you will need to look at the ball. Instead, as a shooter, you must keep your attention on the rim. Always know exactly where the rim is because then your brain subconsciously keeps the angle and distance calculation. This increases your focus and increases the chance of making the basket when you actually shoot.

Proper Finish 
After you have taken the shot, it is very important to have the correct follow through. Your wrist should be relaxed and not tense. The entire motion from the shooting to follow up should be one fluid movement.  Before the start of each game or practice, try shooting 50 shots from the free throw line to get the feel of a shot.
